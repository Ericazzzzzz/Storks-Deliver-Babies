# 🦩 Storks Deliver Babies: A Regression Analysis

**🔍 Project Overview**:  
This project explores the humorous and historically popular claim that "storks deliver babies," examining correlations between stork populations and birth rates across countries. Using regression models, this project illustrates statistical concepts such as spurious correlations and emphasizes the importance of model selection in interpreting data accurately.

**📌 Key Steps**:

1. **Implementing Regression Models** 📈:
   - **Model 1**: A simple linear regression using the number of storks as the sole predictor for birth rates. This model tests the original humorous hypothesis of a stork-birth relationship.
   - **Model 2**: A multiple regression excluding storks, instead using:
     - **Population size (Humans)**: Expected to correlate with birth rate.
     - **GDP per capita**: Higher economic status often links to lower birth rates.
     - **Population density (PopDensity)**: Urban living conditions may influence family size preferences.

2. **Comparison of Models using Bootstrapping** 🔄:
   - Employed bootstrapping to assess the reliability of both models, comparing their performance across different samples to check the stability of coefficients and predictions.
   - Examined the validity of the stork-birth model versus a more realistic population-based model to highlight spurious correlations.

3. **Discussion of Findings** 📝:
   - Analyzed the implications of spurious correlations in statistical analysis, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking in model interpretation.
   - Provided insights on why statistical results, particularly from simple models, must be interpreted with caution to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions.

**🚀 Results**:
- Demonstrated the lack of a causal relationship between stork populations and birth rates.
- Showcased how adding relevant predictors (population size, GDP, population density) improves model reliability, providing a more logical explanation for birth rate variability.
- However, the higher the confidence level, the difference between the two regression models is no longer signfiicant, suggesting that there are variability within the predictors (e.g., GDP, population density) that might not have the same predictive power across all populations.
